        Recipe from Jo Mysicka
    </h2>
    <p>
        - 2 cups chopped onions
        <br>
        - 1 pound ground beef
        <br>
        - 1 cup ketchup
        <br>
        - 2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard (like French’s)
        <br>
        - 2 teaspoons cider or red wine vinegar
        <br>
        - 2 x 28 ounce (1 lb 12 oz) cans of pork & beans in tomato sauce
        <br>
        - 1 x 1 pound (15 to 16 oz) can of kidney beans, drained
        <br>
        - 1 package of hot dogs or Polish kielbasa, sliced into bite sized pieces 
        (could be increased to 2 packages) 
        (we most commonly use 20 hotdog packages) 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Preheat oven to 400°F.
        <br>
        <br>
        In a large dutch oven, brown meat and onion in a little olive or vegetable oil over medium-high heat until meat is
        cooked and onion is soft. Drain off fat. Add the remaining ingredients and stir together. Simmer on the stove for a
        few minutes to heat up mixture. Put lid on pot and place in oven.
        <br>
        <br>
        Bake at 400°F for 30 to 40 minutes or until hot dog is done (it will look a little puffed). Use caution when
        removing lid – it’s easy to forget the hot pad!
