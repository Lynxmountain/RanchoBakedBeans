        <br>
        - 2 teaspoons cider or red wine vinegar
        <br>
        - 2 x 28 ounce (1 lb 12 oz) cans of pork & beans in tomato sauce
        <br>
        - 1 x 1 pound (15 to 16 oz) can of kidney beans, drained
        <br>
        - 1 package of hot dogs or Polish kielbasa, sliced into bite sized pieces

        1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. In a large dutch oven, brown ground beef and onion in a little olive or vegetable oil over medium-high heat until meat is
        cooked and onion is soft. 
        3. Drain off fat. 
        4. Add the remaining ingredients and stir together. 
        5. Simmer on the stove for a few minutes to heat up mixture. Put lid on pot and place in oven.

        6. Bake at 400°F for 30 to 40 minutes or until hot dog is done (it will look a little puffed).
